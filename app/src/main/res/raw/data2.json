		"text": "<span class=\"nonkeywords\">The pioneers of the teaching of <b>science</b> imagined that its introduction into education would </span><b>remove the conventionality, artificiality, and backward-lookingness which were characteristic of classical studies</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\">, but they were gravely disappointed. So, too, in their time had the humanists thought that the study of the classical authors in the original would banish at once the dull pedantry and superstition of mediaeval scholasticism. The professional<br> schoolmaster was a match for both of them, and has almost managed to make the understanding of chemical reactions as dull and as dogmatic an affair as the reading of Virgil's Aeneid. The chief claim for the use of </span><b>science in education</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\"> is that it</span> <b>teaches a child something about the actual universe in which he is living</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\">, in making him acquainted with the results of scientific discovery, and at the same time </span><b>teaches him how to think logically and inductively by studying scientific method</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\">. A certain limited success has been reached in the first of these aims, but practically none at all in the second. Those privileged members of the community who have been through a secondary or public school education may be expected to know something about the elementary physics and chemistry of a hundred years ago, but they probably know hardly more than any bright boy can pick up from an interest in wireless or scientific hobbies out of school hours. As to the learning of scientific method, the whole thing is palpably a farce. Actually, for the </span><b>convenience of teachers and the requirements of the examination system</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\">, it is necessary that the pupils not only </b><b>do not learn scientific method</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\"> but learn precisely the reverse, that is, to </b><b>believe exactly what they are told and to reproduce it</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\"> when asked, whether it seems nonsense to them or not. The way in which educated people respond to such </span><b>quackeries as spiritualism or astrology</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\">, not to say more dangerous ones such as racial theories or currency myths, shows that </span><b>fifty years of education in the method of science in Britain or Germany has produced no visible effect whatever</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\">. The </span><b>only way of learning the method of science is</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\"> the long and bitter way of </span><b>personal experience</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\">, and, until the educational or social systems are altered to make this possible, the </span><b>best we can expect is the production of a minority of people who are able to acquire some of the techniques of science</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\"> and a still smaller minority who are able to use and develop them.</span>",

		"title": "The Design Competition That Opened Toronto To The World",
		"text": "The election of <b>Nathan Phillips as mayor in 1955</b> marked a symbolic shift for Toronto. Phillips would leave a lasting legacy through his insistence on having an <b>international design competition for a new city hall</b>.<br><br> \"Part of the reason for the competition was a real desire to assert a <b>new identity for the city</b>,\" says <b>George Kapelos, associate professor of architecture and planning at Ryerson University</b> and author of Competing Modernisms: Toronto's New City Hall and Square. Phillips was the city’s <b>first Jewish mayor</b>. \"Up until then, Toronto had been a very Protestant city ruled by an Anglo-Irish elite,\" he adds.<br><br> Before the mayor had his way, a <b>1955 plan for a new city hall</b> had been <b>denounced</b> by University of Toronto architecture students as a <b>\"funeral home of vast dimensions.\"</b> What Phillips and many in his competition jury wanted instead was a <b>\"new kind of modernity,\"</b> says Kapelos, \"one that was more humanistic and established places of meaning in the country.\"<br><br> A little more than a year after the international design competition for a new Sydney Opera House, Toronto’s competition in 1958 brought in <b>over 500 entries</b> from all over the world. The proposals were often bold and modern—exactly what Phillips had hoped for in a time, Kapelos tells CityLab, of \"growing concern over an Americanization of Canada and the corporatization of modernity.\"<br><br> With the submissions eventually narrowed down to a final eight, <b>Finland’s Viljo Revell won the jury over</b>, submitting a design that has endured as a progressive symbol of Toronto to this day.<br><br> The curved, two-towered complex—<b>known as Nathan Phillips Square—was completed in 1965</b>. It was an instant hit and showered with praise from the Canadian press. \"People were caught up in the spirit of the time, the sense that ‘wow, we’re now on an international stage and we have a building that will be iconic for the city,'\" says Kapelos, who is still looking to track down some of the living contestants for a larger work on the 509 submissions.<br><br>   Revell, however, <b>never got to see his model brought to life</b>. <b>One year before its grand opening, the 54-year-old died after suffering a heart attack.</b> Since then, its public square has been the de-facto gathering place for <b>local protests and celebrations</b>. Internationally, the city’s emergence as a go-to filming site has given city hall <b>more TV and movie cameos</b> than anyone would have expected in 1958.<br><br> Its success, however, is not only a credit to Revell, but the process that led to his selection. A changing city seized an opportunity, building a civic monument that questioned the traditional and opened itself up to the world for new answers. Half a century later, Toronto is still reaping the benefits of its own curiosity.",

Sadly, some just travel in the wrong circles, and don’t even know this is a local specialty… though it is sold or in several local bakeries. I suppose it could be missed. It certainly tastes far better than it looks.<br><br> Introduced to this \"Winnipeg Specialty” in last month’s The Canadian Food Experience Project Round Up via Tummy Grumbles, I knew instantly that I had to make it. No one knows who was the first mom to name this cake <b>\"The Schmoo”</b>, but interestingly, \"…the actual origin of <b>Al Capp’s word \"shmoo”</b> has been the <b>subject of debate by linguists for decades</b>, leading to the misconception that the term was derived from \"schmo” or \"schmooze.” However, \"shmue” was a <b>taboo Yiddish term for the uterus</b>. It’s one of many Yiddish slang variations that would find their way into Li’l Abner. Revealing an important key to the story, Al Capp himself wrote that the Shmoo <b>metaphorically</b> represented the <b>limitless bounty of the earth in all its richness…</b>” Knowing this and understanding how popular the animated Schmoo character was in the early to mid 1900’s, one can see how a yummy cake made for a coming of age event could be titled \"The Schmoo” in the early to mid 1900’s as every mother wished to present her son with \"the limitless bounty of the earth in all its richness…”<br><br> I was going to make it last week, then didn’t get to it, and it was a birthday Tuesday. Perfect. Though I had planned to make the traditional Serbian Birthday Bombe Torte, my daughter delved into The Schmoo. One can never have enough birthday cakes and it seemed perfect to present Vanja with \"the limitless bounty of the earth in all its richness…” for his birthday, too.<br><br> This recipe is made in an <b>Angel Food Cake tube pan: whites beaten sweet and to stiff peaks, yolks beaten to golden thick voluptuousness.</br> The recipe photo essay follows and the written recipe follows at the end.<br><br> It became apparent to me when filling the tube pan that I needed <br>twice the amount of batter</br> if this was going to rise like an angel food cake, and I assumed it <b>would not rise as much due to the nuts folded into it</b>. Once out of the oven, I could see I was right. I have, therefore, <br>doubled the recipe to accommodate for making this in a tube pan</br>. I did not double the cream as it is evident that there is far too much cream between the layers and around the cake.<br><br> <br>Ground pecans</br> were also sprinkled around the sides… and then the cake was placed in the freezer to firm up before dinner.",
