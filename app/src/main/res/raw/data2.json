		"text": "<span class=\"nonkeywords\">The pioneers of the teaching of <b>science</b> imagined that its introduction into education would </span><b>remove the conventionality, artificiality, and backward-lookingness which were characteristic of classical studies</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\">, but they were gravely disappointed. So, too, in their time had the humanists thought that the study of the classical authors in the original would banish at once the dull pedantry and superstition of mediaeval scholasticism. The professional<br> schoolmaster was a match for both of them, and has almost managed to make the understanding of chemical reactions as dull and as dogmatic an affair as the reading of Virgil's Aeneid. The chief claim for the use of </span><b>science in education</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\"> is that it</span> <b>teaches a child something about the actual universe in which he is living</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\">, in making him acquainted with the results of scientific discovery, and at the same time </span><b>teaches him how to think logically and inductively by studying scientific method</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\">. A certain limited success has been reached in the first of these aims, but practically none at all in the second. Those privileged members of the community who have been through a secondary or public school education may be expected to know something about the elementary physics and chemistry of a hundred years ago, but they probably know hardly more than any bright boy can pick up from an interest in wireless or scientific hobbies out of school hours. As to the learning of scientific method, the whole thing is palpably a farce. Actually, for the </span><b>convenience of teachers and the requirements of the examination system</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\">, it is necessary that the pupils not only </b><b>do not learn scientific method</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\"> but learn precisely the reverse, that is, to </b><b>believe exactly what they are told and to reproduce it</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\"> when asked, whether it seems nonsense to them or not. The way in which educated people respond to such </span><b>quackeries as spiritualism or astrology</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\">, not to say more dangerous ones such as racial theories or currency myths, shows that </span><b>fifty years of education in the method of science in Britain or Germany has produced no visible effect whatever</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\">. The </span><b>only way of learning the method of science is</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\"> the long and bitter way of </span><b>personal experience</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\">, and, until the educational or social systems are altered to make this possible, the </span><b>best we can expect is the production of a minority of people who are able to acquire some of the techniques of science</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\"> and a still smaller minority who are able to use and develop them.</span>",

It was </span><b>the fulcrum</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\"> with which she hoped </span><b>to move the world</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\">; but it was only the fulcrum. For</span><b> more than a generation she was to sit in secret, working her lever</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\">: and </span><b>her real life began</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\"> at the very moment </span><b>when, in popular imagination, it had ended. </b><br><br><span class=\"nonkeywords\">She arrived in England</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\"> in a </span><b>shattered state of health</b>. <span class=\"nonkeywords\">The <b>hardships</b> <span class=\"nonkeywords\">and the </span><b>ceaseless efforts</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\"> of the </span><b>last two years</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\"> had <span><b>undermined</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\"> her </spam><b>nervous system</b>;<span class=\"nonkeywords\"> her </span><b>heart was affected</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\">; she </span><b>suffered constantly from fainting-fits</b> and <b>terrible attacks of utter physical prostration</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\">. The </span><b>doctors declared</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\"> that one thing alone would save her -</span><b> a complete and prolonged rest.</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\"> But that was also the one thing with which </span><b>she would have nothing to do. She had <b>never been in the habit of resting; why</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\"> should she begin </span><b>now?</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\">  Now, when her </span>opportunity had come </b><span class=\"nonkeywords\">at last; now, when the iron was hot, and </span><b>it was time to strike? No; she had work to do</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\">; and, come what might, she would do it. The </span><b>doctors</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\"> protested in vain; in vain</span><b> her family</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\"> lamented and entreated, in vain </span><b>her friends  pointed out to her the madness</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\"> of such a course. </span><b>Madness? Mad -  possessed - perhaps she was. <span class=\"nonkeywords\">A frenzy had seized upon her.As she lay upon her sofa, gasping, </span><b>she devoured blue-books, dictated letters,</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\"> and, in the intervals of her palpitations, cracked jokes. </span><b>For months</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\"> at a stretch</span><b> she never left her bed. But she would not rest. </b><br><br><span class=\"nonkeywords\">At this rate, the </span><b>doctors assured her</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\">, even if she did not die, </span><b>she would become an invalid for life. She could not help that; there was work to be done; </b><span class=\"nonkeywords\">and, as for rest, very likely she might rest... when she had done it. Wherever she went, to London or in the country, in the hills of Derbyshire, or among the rhododendrons at Embley, </span><b>she was haunted by </b><span class=\"nonkeywords\">a ghost. It was the specter of </span><b>Scutari - the hideous vision of the organization of a military hospital.</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\"> She would lay that phantom, or she would perish. The whole system of </span><b>the Army Medical Department, the education of the Medical Officer,  the regulations of hospital procedure ...rest?</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\"> How could she rest  </span>while these things were as they were</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\">, while, if the like necessity were to arise again, the like results would follow? And</span><b>, even in  peace and at home, what was the sanitary condition of the Army? The mortality in the barracks</b><span class=\"nonkeywords\">, was, she found, </span><b>nearly double the mortality in civil life. 'You might as well take 1, 100 men every year out upon Salisbury Plain and shoot them,' she said.</b> </span><b>After inspecting the hospitals at Chatham, she smiled grimly. 'Yes, this is one more symptom of the system which, in the Crimea, put to death 16,000 men.' </span><b>Scutari had given her knowledge; and </b><span class=\"nonkeywords\">it had given her power too: her</span><b> enormous reputation </b><span class=\"nonkeywords\">was at her back - an incalculable force.
